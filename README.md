## General Information  

This project is a growing collection of local/offline TTS (Text-to-Speech) demos used to benchmark and explore different open-source and platform-native voice synthesis engines. Designed for robotics and voice assistant integration, each demo includes a simple GUI or terminal interface for fast testing.  

Goals include:
- [x] Evaluate quality and latency across engines  
- [x] Create GUI wrappers for expressive use  
- [x] Support macOS (Apple Silicon) with MPS where possible  
- [x] Log synthesis times for comparison  
- [x] Establish a foundation for future multi-agent voice stacks
