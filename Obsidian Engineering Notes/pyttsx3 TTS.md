#AIAudio #TTS 


---
### **Current Objective:**

Test pyttsx3’s offline capabilities as a low-footprint fallback TTS engine. Evaluate responsiveness, OS compatibility, and baseline functionality.

---
### **Library Information:**

- **Library Name:** pyttsx3
- **Version:** 2.90
- **License:** BSD
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3)

---

### **Installation:**

```
pip install pyttsx3
```

---

## **Terminal Application Overview**

This minimal app allows users to:

1. Type text into the terminal
2. Hear it spoken by the system voice
3. Measure voice generation/rendering time
4. Loop until the user exits

---

### **How It Works:**

- Engine initialized with pyttsx3.init()
- Speech rendered via .say() and .runAndWait()
- Timing measured with time.perf_counter()

---

### **Sample Interaction:**

```
Enter text to speak: Hello, I am your onboard assistant.
[Telemetry] Rendered in 0.25 seconds
```

---

### **Limitations:**

- Voice quality depends on OS-provided engine
- No control over phoneme or expressive output
- No multi-language or voice switching in one run
- Blocking audio playback (no async)

---

### **Use Case:**

Best used as a fallback or debug TTS on air-gapped systems or older hardware.

---

**Log Status:** Completed

**Notes:** Reliable, low-dependency option. Not suitable for modern voice interaction or expressive agents.
